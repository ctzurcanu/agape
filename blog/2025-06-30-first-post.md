This is the beginning of The Agape Project. A project of artistic effort with deep hopes for the dawn of a new human civilization based on generosity towards others. I begin this with my personal gift to all humans, to all countries, to all religions, every ethos. Total now: 1030 videos. May this inspire others.

[Agápē](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agape): the highest form of love, charity that is unconditional as an investment in human [virtue](https://virtues.provable.dev/docs/hierarchies).
