## Description

Lyrics: Martin Luther, 1524
Translator: Anonymous, 1858

All praise to you, eternal Lord,
clothed in our human flesh and blood,
a manger choosing for your throne,
while worlds on worlds are yours alone.

The skies did once before you bow;
a virgin's arms contain you now:
the angels who in you rejoiced
now listen for your infant voice.

A little child, you are our guest,
that weary ones in you may rest;
forlorn and lowly is your birth,
that we may rise to heav'n from earth.

You came to us in darkest night
to make us children of the light,
to make us, in the realms divine,
as your own angels round you shine.

All this for us your love has done;
by this to you our love is won:
for this we tune our cheerful lays,
and shout our thanks in ceaseless praise.
