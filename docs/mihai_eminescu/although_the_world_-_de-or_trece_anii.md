## Description

Lyrics: Mihai Eminescu, 1883
Translation (from Romanian): Corneliu M. Popescu

Although the world would call me free 
Each year the more her slave am I, 
For in her very way to be 
There's I don't know what, I don't know why. 

Already from the day we met 
Was my freedom mortal shot? 
She's but a girl as they, and yet 
There's something more, I don't know what. 

No matter what we speak, or do, 
The moments in sweet silence fly, 
For somehow there is music too 
When she is mute, I don't know why. 

So likely to my dying day 
To follow her will be my lot, 
For in her sweet and candid way 
There's I don't know why, I don't know what. 

Romanian:

De-or trece anii cum trecura,
Ea tot mai mult îmi va place,
Pentru ca-n toat-a ei faptura
E-un "nu stiu cum" s-un "nu stiu ce".

M-a fermecat cu vreo scânteie
Din clipa-n care ne vazum ?
Desi nu e decât femeie,
E totusi altfel, "nu stiu cum".

De-aceea una-mi este mie
De ar vorbi, de ar tace;
Dac-al ei glas e armonie,
E si-n tacere-i "nu stiu ce".

Astfel robit de-aceeasi jale
Petrec mereu acelasi drum...
In taina farmecelor sale
E-un "nu stiu ce" s-un "nu stiu cum".
