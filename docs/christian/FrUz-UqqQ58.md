## Come, Holy Spirit, God and Lord!

Lyrics: Martin Luther, 1524  
Translator: Catherine Winkworth, 1855

Come, Holy Spirit, God and Lord!  
Let all your graces be outpoured  
On each believer's mind and heart;  
Your fervent love to us impart.

Lord, by the brightness of your light,  
You in the faith do men unite  
Of every land and every tongue;  
This to your praise, O Lord, be sung.

From every error keep us free;  
Let none but Christ our Master be,  
That we in living faith abide,  
In him with all our might confide.

Come, Holy Spirit, God and Lord!  
Let all your graces be outpoured  
On each believer's mind and heart;  
Your fervent love to us impart.

Lord, by your power prepare each heart  
And to our weakness strength impart,  
That bravely here we may contend,  
Through life and death to you ascend.

Come, Holy Spirit, God and Lord!  
Let all your graces be outpoured  
On each believer's mind and heart;  
Your fervent love to us impart.
