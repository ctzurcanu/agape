## Description

Lyrics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agincourt_Carol

Deo gratias Anglia 
redde pro victoria!

Owre Kynge went forth to Normandy
With grace and myght of chyvalry
Ther God for hym wrought mervelusly;
Wherefore Englonde may call and cry

Deo gratias!
Deo gratias Anglia redde pro victoria!

He sette sege, forsothe to say,
To Harflu towne with ryal aray;
That toune he wan and made afray
That Fraunce shal rewe tyl domesday.

Deo gratias!
Deo gratias Anglia redde pro victoria!

Then went hym forth, owre king comely,
In Agincourt feld he faught manly;
Throw grace of God most marvelously,
He had both feld and victory.

Deo gratias!
Deo gratias Anglia redde pro victoria!

Ther lordys, erles and barone
Were slayne and taken and that full soon,
Ans summe were broght into Lundone
With joye and blisse and gret renone.

Deo gratias!
Deo gratias Anglia redde pro victoria!

Almighty God he keep owre kynge,
His people, and alle his well-wyllynge,
And give them grace wythoute endyng;
Then may we call and savely syng:

Deo gratias!
Deo gratias Anglia redde pro victoria!
