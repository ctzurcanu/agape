## Description

Lyrics: Christopher Smart, 1753

Sweet is the dew that falls betimes,
And drops upon the leafy limes;  
   Sweet Hermon's fragrant air:  
Sweet is the lily's silver bell,  
And sweet the wakeful tapers' smell  
   That watch for early prayer.

Sweet the young nurse, with love intense,  
Which smiles o'er sleeping innocence;  
   Sweet, when the lost arrive:  
Sweet the musician's ardour beats,  
While his vague mind's in quest of sweets,
   The choicest flowers to hive.  

Strong is the horse upon his speed;  
Strong in pursuit the rapid glede,  
   Which makes at once his game:  
Strong the tall ostrich on the ground;
Strong through the turbulent profound  
   Shoots Xiphias to his aim.  

Strong is the lion—like a coal  
His eyeball,—like a bastion's mole  
   His chest against the foes:
Strong, the gier-eagle on his sail;  
Strong against tide th' enormous whale  
   Emerges as he goes.  

But stronger still, in earth and air,  
And in the sea, the man of prayer,
   And far beneath the tide:  
And in the seat to faith assign'd,  
Where ask is have, where seek is find,  
   Where knock is open wide.  

Precious the penitential tear;
And precious is the sigh sincere,  
   Acceptable to God:  
And precious are the winning flowers,  
In gladsome Israel's feast of bowers  
   Bound on the hallow'd sod.

Glorious the sun in mid career;  
Glorious th' assembled fires appear;  
   Glorious the comet's train:  
Glorious the trumpet and alarm;  
Glorious the Almighty's stretched-out arm;
   Glorious th' enraptured main:  

Glorious the northern lights astream;  
Glorious the song, when God 's the theme;  
   Glorious the thunder's roar:  
Glorious Hosanna from the den;
Glorious the catholic Amen;  
   Glorious the martyr's gore:  

Glorious—more glorious—is the crown  
Of Him that brought salvation down,  
   By meekness call'd thy Son:
Thou that stupendous truth believed;—  
And now the matchless deed 's achieved,  
   Determined, dared, and done!
