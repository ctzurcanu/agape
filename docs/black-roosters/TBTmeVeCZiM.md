## The Black Roosters

Lyrics: Romanian Folklore

The black roosters crow at night,  
Yet dawn refused to give off light.  
Oh, dawns, you sisters of the skies,  
Do not rush forth, do not arise,  
Until this one prepares to go,  
Adorned in silver's lunar glow,  
With ornaments unseen before,  
Before one goes under green floor.

The black roosters crow at night,  
Yet dawn refused to give off light.  
Oh, dawns, you sisters of the skies,  
Do not rush forth, do not arise,  
Until this one prepares to go,  
Adorned in silver's lunar glow,  
With ornaments unseen before,  
Before one goes under green floor.
