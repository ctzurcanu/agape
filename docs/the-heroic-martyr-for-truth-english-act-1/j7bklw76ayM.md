On Sunday, the English lined up in battle on the right bank of the Loire. Joan forbade attacking them. She had an altar erected, and mass was celebrated in the presence of the assembled army. The ceremony finished, she said to those around her:  
“See if the English have their faces turned towards us or their backs!” And as she was told that they were retreating in the direction of Meung:  
"In the name of God, if they go, let them go; it does not please Lord God that we fight them today, you will have them another time."  
Orléans, besieged for eight months, was delivered in four days.
