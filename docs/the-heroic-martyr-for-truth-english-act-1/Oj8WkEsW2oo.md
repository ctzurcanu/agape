On May 23, as she was in Crespy, she learned that the town of Compiègne was closely sieged by the English and the Burgundians.  
She went there with four hundred combatants and entered the city on the 24th, at daybreak. Then, taking part of the garrison with her, she attacked the Burgundians. But the English came to attack her. The French retreated.  
“Don’t think about anything but shooting at them,” Joan shouted, “it’s up to you that they get unnerved!”  
But Joan was carried away by the retreat of her people. Brought back under the ramparts of Compiègne, the French found the bridge raised and the portcullis lowered. However, Joan, forced into the ditches, still defended herself.
