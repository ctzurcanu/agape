She asked to be taken to a church, wanting above all to give thanks to God.  
As an old man said to Joan, speaking of the English:

she replied: “There is nothing impossible to the power of God.”  
And, in fact, her confidence won over everyone around her. The Orleanians, so fearful and discouraged the day before, now fanaticized by her presence, wanted to throw themselves on the enemy and remove their bastilles. Dunois, fearing failure, decided that they would wait for the arrival of the relief army to begin the attack. In the meantime, Joan summoned the English to withdraw and return to their country. They responded with insults.
