## Bayezid and Mircea

Lyrics: Mihai Eminescu  
Translator: Corneliu M. Popescu

Now, as the eagle rises the Sultan's dream came true,   
And year by year invincible that gathering kingdom grew,   
And year by year the emerald flame flew higher in the blast   
As generations came and went, and as each sultan passed;   
Nor was there any nation could its course forbid   
Until up to the Danube rode conquering Bayazid. 

From one bank to the other a bridge of boats was cast   
And all that host marched over midst fanfare trumpet blast,   
The bodyguard of Allah did over the Danube ride   
Darkening with their numbers the Rovine countryside,   
Swarming tens of thousands spreading their tents immense;   
But on the far horizon stood oaks in forest dense. 

Now came a company of men, in front a white flag borne,   
And Bayazid regarding them enquired with haughty scorn:   
"What do you want?"   
"We want but peace, and if it be allowed    
Our Sire would like to speak awhile with you, great Sultan proud."   
At a sigh the way was cleared, and came towards the tent   
A man of calm and simple mien, and with the years bent.   
"Is't Mircea ?"   
"Yes your Highness !"   
"Take heed, for caution warns,   
Lest you your crown exchange against a wreath of thorns."   
"That you have come, great emperor, no heed what be your aim,   
While still at peace I hail you, our greetings that you came;   
But, as to your good council, o may the Lord forgive,   
If you do dream to win this land by force imperative;   
Had you not better return home with calm and peaceful mind   
And show in your imperial strength that you are just and kind...   
Be the one or be the other, but little does it awe,   
Gladly shall we take our fare, either peace or war."   
"What, when nations open their gates before my trump   
You think my hosts will stumble against a rotten stump ?   
You do not guess, old dotard, the force my foes deployed   
The West's most noble flower these soldiers have destroyed.   
O'er all the cross does shelter, emperors and kings,   
The crescent moon ascending its silver shadow flings.   
Aye, clad in gleaming armour the cavaliers of Malta,   
The Pope who wears three crowns and guards the Holy Altar   
Lightning against lightning set and thunder against thunder,    
A storm that fraught the sea with fear and filled the earth with wonder.    
I needed but to make a sign, a movement of my head    
And all the nations in my path in wild disorder fled;    
For strong to overthrow the cross did march a mighty host    
O'er sea its rule from land to land, on land from coast to coast;   
Shattering the peace of earth as it did march along,    
Darkening the countryside in tens of thousand strong.    
Our lances stood uncounted like a field of growing corn,    
And tremble did the ocean o'er which our ships were borne.    
At Nicopolis you no doubt saw how many camps were brought,    
As though a shining metal wall of swords and spears wrought.   
But when I saw their number like the leaves and like the grass,    
I swore that I would crush them down and through their midst would pass;    
I swore that I would scatter them as wild upflings the foam,    
And give my charger hay and oats in the Vatican at Rome...    
Yet you before my legions imagine you can stand,    
You ridiculous old dotard, with a bare staff in your hand ?"    
"To that old dotard, Emperor, aught one courtesy accord    
For over all Wallachia 'tis he the chosen lord.    
And wiser you would guard your words, nor yet too loudly boast,    
Lest should the furious Danube flood engulf your fleeing host.    
Along the rolling ages many there were who came    
Since Darius Hystaspis of tall immortal fame;   
Many there were who flung their dream across the Danube's tide   
And set their bridges ship to ship and over them did ride;   
Emperors unnumbered, for their cruelty renowned,   
Who came to us with hungry eyes for water and for ground;   
And though I would not care to brag, tell you this thing I must:    
Little time went by ere they were water and were dust.   
You boast that on your conquering road no gates for long were closed   
Though all the flower of the West your vanguard's march opposed;   
But what the high aspiring cause that did their hearts endure ?    
The vanity of every brave, of every cavalier;   
The pomp of noisy conquest; for they had set their vow    
To tear the pride from out your heart, the laurels from your brow.    
But I defend the poverty and the needs of a struggling land    
And therefore all the rocks and streams and hills that guardian stand    
And all that grows and moves and breathes to me is ally true,    
While every blade of grass and stone is enemy to you;    
We have small hosts, yet love of soil had ever power to rid    
This flowering land of all its foes. Prepare then Bayazid !"
