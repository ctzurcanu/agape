## Description

Lyrics: Dimitrie Bolintineanu, Christian Tzurcanu
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_the_Great

On a black cliff, in an ancient keep,
Where a small river winds, murmuring deep,
A young queen weeps, her sorrows entwined,
Sweet as a carnation, pure, soft, and refined.

For her beloved, lost to war’s cruel tide,
Marched with his army, never to abide.
Her blue eyes brim with tears’ bitter glow,
Like violets trembling in early morning’s dew.

Golden locks cascade down her snow-white breast,
Roses and lilies have had her face blessed.
Yet the queen mother guards her with strong grace,
Soothing her spirit in her love’s embrace.

The clock tolls midnight, the night is half worn,
At the castle gate a knock rings, forlorn.
“I am your son, returned from the fray,
Wounded and weary, turned night into day.

Fate struck us harshly — our ranks torn apart,
My shattered army flees, broken at the heart.
But open the gate! The Turks close near…
Cold winds howl… All my wounds sear!”

The young queen leaps to the window’s light.
“Stay, child!” the mother commands, with her might.
She strides to the gate, her voice is like steel:
“Stranger, what trick do your words conceal?

Stephen is far, where brave banners soar—
His arm strikes fear in battles and war.
I am his mother; he is of my blood.
If you are he, then claim no such brood!

But if heaven’s hand, to test my soul,
Has warped your spirit, once noble and whole—
If you are Stephen, prove me your might!
No entry here without victorious right.

Return to battle! For this land, fight—die!
Your grave will be where the heroes lie!”

Return to battle! For this land, fight—die!
Your grave will be where the heroes lie!”

Stephen obeys, his horn’s blast rings clear,
Gathering remnants from valleys drear.
The war roars anew… Foes fall like grain,
Scythed by his wrath on the blood-red plain.

Return to battle! For this land, fight—die!
Your grave will be where the heroes lie!”

Stephen obeys, his horn’s blast rings clear,
Gathering remnants from valleys drear.
The war roars anew… Foes fall like grain,
Scythed by his wrath on the blood-red plain.

The war roars anew… Foes fall like grain,
Scythed by his wrath on the blood-red plain.
