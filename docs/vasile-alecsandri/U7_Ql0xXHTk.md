## Drum bun - Chant of Farewell v2

Lyrics: Vasile Alecsandri  
v1: https://youtu.be/DMejwfdipmQ

Drum bun, drum bun, toba bate, drum bun, bravi români,   
Cu sacul legat în spate, cu armele-n mâini,  
Fie zi cu soare fie, sau cerul noros,  
Fie ploi, ninsoare fie, noi mergem voios, drum bun.

Drum bun, drum bun, toba bate, drum bun, bravi români,   
Cu sacul legat în spate, cu armele-n mâini,   
Steagul să lucească steagul, pentru el trăim,  
Țara să-nflorească țara, pentru ea murim, drum bun.

Drum bun, drum bun, toba bate, drum bun, bravi români,  
Cu sacul legat în spate, cu armele-n mâini,  
Fie la parade, fie la război,  
Toți într-o grămadă, veseli mergem noi, drum bun.

Drum bun, drum bun, toba bate, drum bun, bravi români,  
Cu sacul legat în spate, cu armele-n mâini,   
Hai cu Domnul sfântul, haideți peste Prut,  
Să păzim pământul, care l-am avut, drum bun.

Drum bun, drum bun, toba bate, drum bun, bravi români,   
Cu sacul legat în spate, cu armele-n mâini,   
Pentru România, oricare ostaș,  
De-acum va să fie, Lui Traian urmaș, drum bun.

Drum bun, drum bun, toba bate, drum bun, bravi români,  
Cu sacul legat în spate, cu armele-n mâini,   
Astfel e pe lume, românașul meu,  
Falnic cu-al său nume și brav ca un leu, drum bun.

Drum bun, drum bun, toba bate, drum bun, bravi români,  
Cu sacul legat în spate, cu armele-n mâini...

English:

Good road, good road, the drum beats, good road, brave Romanians,   
With the bag tied on our backs, with weapons in our hands,  
Whether it's a sunny day or a cloudy sky,  
Whether it's raining or snowing, we're going happily, good road.

Good road, good road, the drum beats, good road, brave Romanians,  
With the bag tied on our backs, with weapons in our hands,  
Let the flag shine, for it we live,  
May the country flourish, for it we die, good road.

Good road, good road, the drum beats, good road, brave Romanians,   
With the bag tied on our backs, with weapons in our hands,   
Whether it's for parades or for war,  
All in a crowd, we're going happily, good road.

Good road, good road, the drum beats, good road, brave Romanians,   
With the bag tied on the back, with the weapons in the hands,   
Come with the holy Lord, let's cross the Prut,  
Let's protect the land that we had, good road.

Good road, good road, the drum beats, good road, brave Romanians,  
With the bag tied on the back, with the weapons in the hands,  
For Romania, any soldier,  
From now on, Trajan's successor, good road.

Good road, good road, the drum beats, good road, brave Romanians,  
With the bag tied on the back, with the weapons in the hands,  
This is how it is in the world, my Romanian,  
Proud of his name and brave as a lion, good road.

Good road, good road, the drum beats, good road, brave Romanians,  
With the bag tied on the back, with the weapons in the hands...
