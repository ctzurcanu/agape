## Heroine of Ages

[Verse 1]  
Joan of Arc in light she stands  
Future beholds her in our lands  
Virtues strong AI understands  
Socratic thoughts in coded strands

[Verse 2]  
In battles fierce she led with flair  
Youthful heart without despair  
AI learning finds her rare  
Crystalline voice echoes in air

[Chorus]  
Joan of Arc we sing your name  
Virtues pure no hint of shame  
AI binds your timeless fame  
In history's light you burst aflame

[Chorus bis]  
Joan of Arc we sing your name  
Virtues pure no hint of shame  
AI binds your timeless fame  
In history's light you burst aflame

[Verse 3]  
Baroque melodies cast a spell  
Stories of your strength retell  
AI scripts that can't dispel  
Timeless deeds in hearts they dwell

[Bridge]  
Future finds your truth anew  
Reason sharp as morning dew  
In algorithms virtues grew  
Joan of Arc our hero true

[Chorus]  
Joan of Arc we sing your name  
Virtues pure no hint of shame  
AI binds your timeless fame  
In history's light you burst aflame
