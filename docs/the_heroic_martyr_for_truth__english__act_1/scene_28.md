After the coronation of Reims, Joan wanted to move strongly towards Paris and retake the capital of the kingdom. The King's indecision gave the English time to make their defense preparations. The assault was repulsed; Joan was wounded by a crossbow bolt to the thigh.
She had to be taken by force from the foot of the ramparts to force her to stop the fight. The next day, the King opposed the recommencement of the attack; Joan, however, was responsible for the lack of success. 
For quite a long time Charles had been dragged along the roads; he was impatient to resume his indolent life in his castles of Touraine.
