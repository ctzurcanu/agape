One day, Stafford and Warwick came to see her with Jean de Luxembourg. And as he, mockingly, told her that he was coming to buy her back if she promised not to arm herself against England again:
“In the name of God,” she replied, “you are making fun of me, because I know very well that you have neither the will nor the power; I know very well that the English will put me to death, believing, after my death, to gain the kingdom of France; but even if they were a hundred thousand more, they would not have the kingdom."
Furious, the Earl of Stafford threw himself at her.
He would have killed her without the intervention of the assistants.
