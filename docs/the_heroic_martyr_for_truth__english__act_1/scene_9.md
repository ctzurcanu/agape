The troops gathered in Blois. Joan arrived there followed by the Duke of Alençon, Marshal de Boussac, the Lord of Rais, La Hire, and Xaintrailles.
On her banner, she had the image of God and the names of Jesus and Maria embroidered. She advised her soldiers to sort out their consciences and confess before going out to fight. On Thursday, April 28, the small army set out. Joan led the way, her banner in the wind, to the song of “Veni, Creator”. 
She wanted to march straight towards Orléans; the leaders thought it more prudent to go via the left bank of the Loire.
