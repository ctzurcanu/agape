The next day, May 6, she captured the Augustinian bastille. On Saturday 7, early in the morning, the attack on the Tournelles bastille began. Joan, lowered into the ditch, was raising a ladder against the parapet, when a crossbow bolt pierced her right through between the neck and the shoulder. She tore the iron from the wound; she was then offered to charm the wound, she refused, saying "that she would rather die than do anything that was against the will of God". She confessed and prayed for a long time while her troops rested. Then giving the order to restart the assault, she threw herself into the heat of the fight, shouting to the attackers:
“It’s all yours, come in!”
The bastille was taken, and all the defenders perished. There was no longer an Englishman left on the left bank of the Loire.
