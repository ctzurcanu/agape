## Texas, Our Texas

Lyrics: William J. Marsh, Gladys Yoakum Wright

Texas, Our Texas!  
all hail the mighty State!  
Texas, Our Texas!  
so wonderful so great!  
Boldest and grandest,  
withstanding ev'ry test  
O Empire wide and glorious,  
you stand supremely blest.

Texas, O Texas!  
your freeborn single star,  
Sends out its radiance  
to nations near and far,  
Emblem of Freedom!  
it set our hearts aglow,  
With thoughts of San Jacinto  
and glorious Alamo.

Texas, dear Texas!  
from tyrant grip now free,  
Shines forth in splendor,  
your star of destiny!  
Mother of heroes,  
we come your children true,  
Proclaiming our allegiance,  
our faith, our love for you.

God bless you Texas!  
And keep you brave and strong,  
That you may grow in power and worth,  
throughout the ages long.  
God bless you Texas!  
And keep you brave and strong,  
That you may grow in power and worth,  
throughout the ages long.
