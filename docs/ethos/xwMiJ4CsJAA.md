## Arizona

Lyrics: Margaret Rowe Clifford, 1915   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_songs_of_Arizona 

Come to this land of sunshine,  
To this land where life is young.  
Where the wide, wide world is waiting,  
The songs that will now be sung.  
Where the golden sun is flaming  
Into warm, white shining day.  
And the sons of men are blazing  
Their priceless right of way.

Sing the song that's in your hearts,  
Sing of the great Southwest.  
Thank God, for Arizona,  
In splendid sunshine dressed.  
For thy beauty and thy grandeur,  
For thy regal robes so sheen,  
We hail thee Arizona  
Our Goddess and our queen.

Come stand beside the rivers  
Within our valleys broad.  
Stand here with heads uncovered,  
In the presence of our God!  
While all around, about us  
The brave, unconquered band,  
As guardians and landmarks  
The giant mountains stand.

Sing the song that's in your hearts,  
Sing of the great Southwest.  
Thank God, for Arizona,  
In splendid sunshine dressed.  
For thy beauty and thy grandeur,  
For thy regal robes so sheen,  
We hail thee Arizona  
Our Goddess and our queen.

Not alone for gold and silver  
Is Arizona great.  
But with graves of heroes sleeping,  
All the land is consecrate!  
O come and live beside us  
However far ye roam  
Come help us build up temples  
And name those temples “home.”

Sing the song that's in your hearts,  
Sing of the great Southwest.  
Thank God, for Arizona,  
In splendid sunshine dressed.  
For thy beauty and thy grandeur,  
For thy regal robes so sheen,  
We hail thee Arizona  
Our Goddess and our queen.
