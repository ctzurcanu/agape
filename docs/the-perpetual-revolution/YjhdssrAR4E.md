## If I had a hammer

Lyrics: Pete Seeger, Lee Hays, 1949  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I_Had_a_Hammer

If I had a hammer, I'd hammer in the morning   
I'd hammer in the evening, all over this land   
I'd hammer out danger, I'd hammer out a warning   
I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters all over this land 

If I had a bell, I'd ring it in the morning   
I'd ring it in the evening, all over this land   
I'd ring it in danger, I'd ring out a warning   
I'd ring in love between my brothers and my sisters all over this land 

If I had a song, I'd sing it in the morning   
I'd sing it in the evening, all over this land   
I'd sing it in danger, I'd sing out a warning   
I'd sing in love between my brothers and my sisters all over this land 

Well I got a hammer and I got a bell   
And I got a song to sing all over this land   
It's the hammer of justice, it's the bell of freedom   
It's a song about love between my brothers and my sisters all over this land

Well I got a hammer and I got a bell   
And I got a song to sing all over this land   
It's the hammer of justice, it's the bell of freedom   
It's a song about love between my brothers and my sisters all over this land
