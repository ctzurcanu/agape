## Description

Music from the well-known Ukrainian song of Shchedryk (later the Carol of the Bells).

Lyrics:

My France, my France! 
If you cannot laugh in Orleans, 
weep in Paris and in Rouen, 
laugh even more as Parisien 
Then you can't know how my heart beats 
For your own glorious good

As in the past glorious France 
In the lands of King Charlemagne 
And the days of Napoleon 
The victorious 
beautiful Marianne 
Then you can not know 
How their hearts are still 
Beating bells for France
Then you can not know 
How their hearts are still 
beating bells for France
