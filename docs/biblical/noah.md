## Description

[Chorus]
Well it's a-oh, Noah
Oh, oh, Noah
Oh-ho, oh, Noah
My God's gonna ride 
on the wind and tide
Well, it's a-oh, oh, Noah
Oh, oh, Noah
Oh-ho, oh, Noah
My Godâ€™s gonna ride 
on the wind and tide
Brother Noah
(God's gonna ride on the wind and tide)
My God's talkin'
(My God's gonna ride on the wind and tide)
Said he would ride
(God's gonna ride on the wind and tide)
On the wind and tide
(My God's gonna ride on the wind and tide)

[Verse 1]
Hey children, stop, be still and listen to me
When God walked down to the brandy sea
He declared that the evil descend from man
And then he decided to destroy the land
He spoke to Noah, and Noah stopped
He said "Noah, I want you to build me an ark
I want you to build it three cubits long
I want you to build it big and strong
I want it thirty high and fifty wide
So it will stand the wind and tide"

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, Noah
Oh, oh, Noah
Oh-ho, oh, Noah
My God's gonna ride 
on the wind and tide
Well, it's a-oh, oh, Noah
Oh, oh, Noah
Oh-ho, oh, Noah
My God's gonna ride 
on the wind and tide
Mmm, mmm
(God's gonna ride on the wind and tide)
Mmm-hmm
(God's gonna ride on the wind and tide)
Mmm, mmm-hmm
(God's gonna ride on the wind and tide)
Oh-ho, Noah
(God's gonna ride on the wind and tide)
Brother Noah
(My God's gonna ride on the wind and tide)
My God's talkin'
(My God's gonna ride on the wind and tide)
Said he would ride
(My God's gonna ride on the wind and tide)
On the wind and tide
(My God's gonna ride on the wind and tide)

[Verse 2]
Well, after the foundation was laid
Then Noah began to hew and build
The ringin' of the hammer cried judgment
The hewing of the saw cried sin and repent
A hundred years, he hammered and sawed
Buildin' the ark by the grace of God
When the ark was done, God's voice was heard
He said "Now Noah, let me tell you what to do
Call in the animals two by two"
So he called 'em in the ark, two by two
He called the birdie, the ox with the kangaroo
Then he called in Japheth, and Ham, and Shem
Then God began to flood the land
He raised his hands to heaven on high
Shook the stars and moved from the sky
Shook the mountains, he troubled the sea
Hitched the wind to his chariot-to-be
And he stepped on land, stood on the shore
And declared that time there wouldn't be no more

[Outro]
Well, it's a-oh, oh, Noah
Oh-oh, oh, Noah
Oh-ho, oh, Noah
My God's gonna ride 
on the wind and tide
