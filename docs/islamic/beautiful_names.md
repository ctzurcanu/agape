## Description

Lyrics: Boonaa Mohammed
Names: https://youtu.be/6IuRBe_Pqa8

Before the creation of the Heavens and the Universe
There was only One, Allah, Rabbil Alameen
Al-Wahid [The One] who made the sun, and planted the stars like trees
Al-Ahad [The Unique] the unique One, with no need of slumber or sleep
Al-Khaliq [The Creator] created you like kun fayakun
From the womb to the tomb, Ar-Raqeeb [The Watchful] is always watching you
Al-Muwsawwir [The Fashioner of Forms] fashioned them, and gave you all your faculties

And all praise be to Al-Hameed [The Praised], to He that is perfect and complete
And glory be to Al-Majeed [The All Glorious], majestically honorable indeed
And why would He need Money, when He is Al-Ghani [The Rich]?
Ar-Razzaq [The Provider] fulfills the needs of even the birds and the bees
While Al-Wahab [The All-Giver] bestows his bounties out of love and mercy
And you could try and count all His blessings, but He is Al-Atheem [The Magnificent]
Cause Al-Malik [The King] is the only King with servants He doesn′t need
Al-Hayy [The Ever Living] is alive and
Al-Qayyum [The Everlasting] will never die
Al-Ala [The Most High] beyond the skies, and Al-Hakim [The All Wise] the most Wise, No lies
But why would they try to prescribe As-Samad [The Self Sufficient] just one son?

Al-Hakam [The Judge] is the judge
As-Sayyed [The Master] master above
Waging war against Al-Aziz [The Almighty] is like spitting at the sun
Allah is [The Beautiful] Al-Jameel and loves that which is Jamel
And why would you have fear when Al-Wali [The Protector] is by your side
The most gentle Ar Rafiq [The Gentle], has the firmness of Al-Mateen [The Firm]
Musa spoke to As-Samee [The All Hearing] but couldn′t see Al-Basser [The All Seeing]
Al-AwwAl-[The First] was the first
And Al-Akhir [The Last] is the last
Al-Aleem [The All-Knowing] knows the present, and the future and the past
Al-Wasi [The All Encompassing] encompasses all and knows what benefits and harms
As-Shaafi [The Healer] heals the sick and Al-Muhsin [The Doer of Good] gives good to all

Al-Mubin [the Manifest Truth] guides to this deen, making the truth clear and clean
Al-Mu'min [The Giver of Security] can provide security in ways you've never seen
Al-Qadeer [The All Able] does what He pleases, and is capable of all things
And He who kneels before Al-Mutakabbir [The Supreme] can stand up to anything
Victory comes from An-Nasser [The Helper]
So I Give thanks to Al-Shakoor [The Grateful]
Put my trust in Al-Wakeel [the Dependable]
Save my love for Al-Wadood [The Loving]
Ya-Ghafoor [the All Forgiving], Ya-Ghafar [the Ever Forgiving] forgive me for you are al-Afu [The Pardoner]
At-Tawwab [The acceptor of Repentance] we turn to you
Cause you are Al-Quddus [the Most Holy]
Ya-Salaam [The Source of Peace], It is my dream to see you Ya-Kareem [The Bountiful]
Ya-Fattah [the Opener], open the highest gates of Jannah for me. Ameen
Al-Mujeeb [The Responsive] hears my prayers, even when I can′t find the words to say them

And Al-Qawiy [the Strong] gives me strength to live a life of dedication
To Al-Shaheed [the Witness], being a witness over this entire nation
Al-Hafeedth [The Guardian] protect this Ummah from all the fitnah and temptation
Al-Qareeb [the One who is Near] is closer to ourselves than our blood in circulation
Al-Latif [the Kindest] shows us kindness, but most of mankind is ungrateful
Till Al-Haseeb [the Reckoner] takes account, on the day that we′ll be standing naked
Where are their Gods, Al-Jabbar [the Irresistible] will ask all of his creation?
For he is Al-Qahhaar [the Subduer], while the rest are simply imitations

Al-Haqq [The Truth] the only truth, on the day our souls will become awakened
So repent before Al-Waarith [The Inheritor of All] inherits all you've accumulated
Al-Halim [the Forbearing] is patient with us although we have disobeyed Him
Good is from At-Tayyib [The most Good and Pure] and Al-Muhaymin [The Protector] makes observation
Of prostrations to Al-Thaheer [The Manifest] manifesting through His creation
Al-Akram [The Generous] made us Muslims, so let us show appreciation
For He is Al-Jawwaad [The Magnanimous] as revealed in His revelations
For those of contemplation, Al-Kabir [the Great] must be the greatest

Cause knowing Al-Mannan [the Benevolent], is the only key to our salvation
The Proof is Ar-Ra′uf [The Clement], but it's true that their hearts are blinded
And this is just a reminder for those who love to be reminded
Of the most beautiful names and attributes that you will ever see
Like the Mercy of Ar-Rahman [the most Gracious] and the Compassion of ArRaheem [The Most compassionate]
