Kayawc kynhorawc men y delhei
Diffun ymlaen bun med a dalhei
Twll tal y rodawr ene klywei
Awr ny rodei nawd meint dilynei
Ni chilyei o gamhawn eny verei
Waet mal brwyn gomynei gwyr nyt echei
Nys adrawd gododin ar llawr mordei
Rac pebyll madawc pan atcoryei

English:

The Gododdin

I.
He was a man in mind, in years a youth,
And gallant in the din of war;
Fleet, thick-maned chargers
Were ridden by the illustrious hero;
A shield, light and broad,
Hung on the flank of his swift and slender steed;
His sword was blue and gleaming,
His spurs were of gold, his raiment was woollen. 
It will not be my part
To speak of thee reproachfully,
A more choice act of mine will be
To celebrate thy praise in song;
Thou hast gone to a bloody bier,
Sooner than to a nuptial feast;
Thou hast become a meal for ravens,
Ere thou didst reach the front of conflict. 
Alas, Owain! my beloved friend;
It is not meet that he should be devoured by ravens!
There is swelling sorrow in the plain,
Where fell in death the only son of Marro.

II.
Adorned with his wreath, leader of rustic warriors, whenever he came
By his troop unattended, before maidens would he serve the mead;
But the front of his shield would be pierced, if ever he heard
The shout of war; no quarter would he give to those whom he pursued;
Nor would he retreat from the combat until blood flowed;
And he cut down like rushes the men who would not yield.
The Gododin relates, that on the coast of Mordei, 
Before the tents of Madog, when he returned,
But one man in a hundred with him came. 

III.
Adorned with his wreath, the chief of toil, his country’s rod of power,
Darted like an eagle to our harbours, when allured
To the compact that had been formed; his ensign was beloved,
More nobly was his emblazoned resolution performed, for he retreated not,
With a shrinking mind, before the host of Gododin.
Manawyd, with confidence and strength thou pressest upon the tumultuous fight,
Nor dost thou regard either spear or shield;
No habitation rich in dainties can be found,
That has been kept out of the reach of thy warriors’ charge.

IV.
Adorned with a wreath was the leader, the wolf of the holme,
Amber beads in ringlets encircled his temples;
Precious was the amber, worth a banquet of wine. 
He repelled the violence of men, as they glided along;
For Venedotia and the North would have come to his share,
By the advice of the son of Ysgyran,
The hero of the broken shield.

V.
Adorned with his wreath was the leader, and armed in the noisy conflict;
Chief object of observation was the hero, and powerful in the gory field,
Chief fighter in the advanced division, in front of the hosts;
Five battalions fell before his blades;
Even of the men of Deivyr and Bryneich, uttering groans,
Twenty hundred perished in one short hour;
Sooner did he feed the wolf with his carcase, than go to the nuptial feast;
He sooner became the raven’s prey, than approached the altar;
He had not raised the spear ere his blood streamed to the ground;
This was the price of mead in the hall, amidst the throng;
Hyveidd Hir shall be celebrated whilst there remains a minstrel.
