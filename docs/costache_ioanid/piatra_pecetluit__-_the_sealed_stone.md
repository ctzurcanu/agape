## Description

Lyrics: Costache Ioanid

Bătea o aripă de vânt.
Şi noaptea era ca gheena.

Din vale, cu sufletul frânt,
o ceată urca spre mormânt…
Şi-n frunte era Magdalena.

Maria, cea smulsă din iad,
din şapte otgoane de moarte,
trecea printre stânci ca prin vad.

Şi toate-i păreau ca o carte...
Şi-n toate citea lăcrimând
poemul cel scris de curând
cu jilave slove de sânge.

Acolo... privirea-ntorcând,
Isus o văzuse cum plânge.
Aici... El căzuse-n genunchi.
Acolo-i vorbeau heruvimii.
Aici, sprijinit pe un trunchi,
vorbise cu milă mulţimii.

Maria privea mai departe.
Şi gându-i zbura spre mormânt.

"Dar piatra din pragul cel sfânt,
vai, cine-o va da la o parte?"
Bătea o aripă de vânt
deasupra cărării deşarte...

"Dar piatra din pragul cel sfânt,
vai, cine-o va da la o parte?"

English:

A wind blew.
And the night was like hell.

From the valley, with broken souls,
a group climbed towards the tomb…
And at the head was Magdalene.

Mary, the one torn from hell,
from seven pits of death,
was passing through the rocks as if through a ford.

And everything seemed to her like a book…
And in everything she read, weeping
the poem she had recently written
with wet, blood-stained letters.

There... looking back,
Jesus had seen her weeping.
Here... He had fallen to his knees.
There the cherubim were speaking to him.
Here, leaning on a trunk,
He had spoken with pity to the crowd.

Mary looked further.
And her thoughts flew towards the tomb.

"But the stone from the holy threshold,
alas, who will roll it away?"
A wing of wind was beating
over the empty path...

"But the stone of the holy threshold,
alas, who will roll it away?"
